# Chess game
Chess game that was made based on the GitHub console (Git Bash Here). The reason for using the Git console was to be able to use and demonstrate the colors of the pieces and movements more easily.

## Teams, pieces and colors

The game is in English. "P" pieces are pawns, "K" pieces are knights, "B" pieces are bishops, "K" pieces are kings, "R" pieces are towers and "Q" pieces are the queens. The game needs 2 players from different teams to be played, one on the white team that has the white pieces and the other on the black team that has the yellow pieces on the field. As the game progresses, the field shows the pieces that have already been captured, the current turn, and whether any players are in check. At each turn, it is the player's turn to make the move, if the player chooses the wrong piece or tries to make an invalid move the game sends a message and prevents the move, thus asking for another move, until it is valid. The blue positions that appear on the field after the player chooses the piece to be moved show the possible places for the piece to move. The lines and columns of the field to identify the pieces and movements are identified respectively by the numbers 8 to 1 and by the letters "a" to "h", and to choose a piece and make a move the player must write the column first and the line after, and then immediately press the enter key. The game ends when a player is in checkmate, with the field showing the winning player of the game.
